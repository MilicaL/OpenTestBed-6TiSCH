# OpenTestBed-6TiSCH
This repository provides experimental data and data processing scripts.
In this repository you will find experimental data obtained for testing 
IEEE802.15.4g & 6TiSCH applications based on OpenWSN firmware and OpenMoteB 
devices. Here are the results for the tested PHYs:
FSK, O-QPSK, OFDM1 MCS0, OFDM1 MCS1, OFDM1 MCS2, OFDM1 MCS3
Two python scripts are also provided for data processing:
averaging.py & uinject_stats.py
